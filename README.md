# Holiday Shopping Trends - Data / Multimedia Project
[This project is being developed live here](https://drewoday.com/shop/).

## What is this project?
This project is a guide on how to survive holiday shopping.

I'll be mainly looking at violence during Black Friday sales and whether or not the rise of Cyber Monday has created a decrease in violence over the years.

Other things I’ll look at include the growing number of returns and new issues that have risen due to online shopping. 

I also think that this dataset will produce timely and newsworthy stories due to the approaching holiday season. Finding additional local sources also shouldn’t be too difficult because of New York’s large retail market.

This dataset has information on a variety of categories including:

* Holiday retail sales from 2000 to 2018
* Cyber Monday shoppers from 2005 to 2016
* Number of packages returned on National Returns Day since 2016
* When people wake up to go Black Friday shopping
* Money made from online sales during the holiday season
* Number of stores people visit during Black Friday
* Types of items that are impulse buys
* Types of stores visited during Black Friday

## Who did you work with?
This is a solo project.

## Where did you get your data from?
This is paid data from Statista.

This data was compiled from a variety of sources including the National Retail Federation, the U.S. Department of Commerce and independent Statista research surveys. Statista also has additional data that they will be updating for the 2019 holiday season.

## Current status in terms of data acquisition/analysis/visualization:
I've started producing this project. The text will be mostly lorem ipsum until the end of the project.

Some of the questions I want to keep in mind while looking at the data:

* How has Black Friday changed with the introduction of online shopping?
* With online shopping on the rise, have the number of shipped returns increased?
* How are UPS, USPS and FedEx dealing with this huge influx of packages?
* What types of items are the biggest impulse buys?
* Why?
* Is there a psychological reason why people choose these items?
* How do online retailers like Amazon use this information?
* Which brick and mortar stores are the most popular during Black Friday?
* What is the optimal time to wake up for Black Friday shopping?
* Do people take that into account during Thanksgiving?
* If there is location data in these datasets…
* Where are people doing the most shopping?
* Does this correlate with the weather?
* Are people more likely to go Black Friday shopping in areas where it doesn’t get too cold?
* Can I quantify how crazy people get during Black Friday shopping?
* Is there a dataset on the number of arrests made on Black Friday?
* Has that number been increasing or decreasing?
* Could online shopping have an impact on this number?

## Do you have sketches of what the final project might look like?
[Sketches](https://github.com/aow207/holiday-shopping/blob/master/Sketches%20and%20Mocukups/first-draft-sketch.pdf) are available. The high fidelity mockup is currently undergoing changes.
